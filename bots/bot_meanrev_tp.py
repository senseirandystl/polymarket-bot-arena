"""Mean Reversion bot with 2x take-profit via intra-window tick tracking.

This bot ALWAYS opens a position on every market. The position monitor
polls Simmer every 0.5s and closes the position if it ever reaches
100% profit (2x the initial bet). If it never hits 2x, the position
holds until the trading window closes and resolves normally.

Entry logic: same mean-reversion signals, but NEVER skips a market.
Exit logic: early close at 2x via PositionMonitorThread, otherwise hold.
